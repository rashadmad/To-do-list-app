# To-do-list-app
Vanilla JavaScript to-do list app

## Explination
Basically A test that I recieved during an interview. I originally did this in [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/rashadmad/2m3wfx90/) and wanted to bring an object orineted approach to it.

## Mission
Moslty to just keep my self programming. I want to see how much I have improved when it comes to bootstraping an application in a small amount of time
